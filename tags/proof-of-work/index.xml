      <description>Proof of work (PoW) algorithms generally have no notion of progress, instead they are more like playing the lottery millions of times until you win. Losing a million times doesn&amp;rsquo;t influence your chances of winning the next one.
That&amp;rsquo;s ok and probably even desirable for applications like a cryptocurrency mining, but undesirable for an application like hashcash in which the proof of work is used as a payment for say, signing up for a website.</description>
