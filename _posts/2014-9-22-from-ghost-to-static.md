Recently this blog was hosted on my own small server, running [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) on node.js. Now, there is nothing wrong with that. Ghost is pretty great, it does one thing and it does it well, blogging. The programmer in me however, realised that I don't need a dynamic website. All I have are static blog posts and pages that sometimes get edited, so why not make it static (just HTML, CSS and JS)?

## Jekyll
This blog is now running on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). It's hosted and built by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). It allows me to edit and create blog posts anywhere I have access to a browser (by simply editing them in the GitHub repository). It allows for more freedom than Ghost, as I don't have to theme it, I can do whatever I want, as long as it is static. Also I can just zip it up and host it elsewhere if needed.

##Hexo
Another project is now generated using [Hexo](http://hexo.io/), my first impressions are positive. It is easier to get started with it than Jekyll, and provides more freedom in the templating system (as GitHub can't just run any code on their servers). Also it is written in Javascript (nodejs), which is for me easier to understand and hack myself (I am not fluent in Ruby). 

Hexo seems to be pretty popular with asian developers, as you may find asian characters (mostly Taiwanese I think?) in theme descriptions. The documentation of hexo however is in English, and is pretty great, so it's no reason to worry ;).
