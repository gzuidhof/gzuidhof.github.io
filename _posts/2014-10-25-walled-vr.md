With Mozilla and Chrome working on WebVR, I think it is time for virtual reality without walls between engines.
The 2D web doesn't have these walls, it offers many ways to author content and another site is only a click away.

What do links look like in the 3D web? Is it also a text link, or is it a portal you move through? Where in the other 'world' do you appear?
