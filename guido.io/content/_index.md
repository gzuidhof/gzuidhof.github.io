On this website you will find links to some of my current and future [projects](projects). I spend most of my time as co-founder at [Friendly Captcha](https://friendlycaptcha.com).

My (technical) areas of interest are web technologies, machine learning, computer vision, and (3D) visualization. Sometimes I write [posts](posts) about various topics.
