            <p>
               Zarr is a python library for chunked large multi-dimensional datasets. This library is a library that allows one to interact with these large datasets in the browser.
            </p>
            <p>
                This was a particulary large undertaking because the browser (javascript) does not ship with any good support for multidimensional arrays or utilities like slicing, that all had to be implemented from scratch.

                Utilities for converting PyTorch models to Keras and the other way around. More specifically, it allows you to copy the weights from a PyTorch model to an identical model in Keras and vice-versa.

            <p>
                I created this tool out of my own need, and since open sourcing it it has been starred over a hundred times on GitHub. <br>
                It is unique in the way it works from other tools, as it does not infer the model structure itself. That is where every other tool has the most difficulty (and often fails). In this tool instead you define the same model architecture yourself.

            <p>
                Armed with access to a large corpus of hundreds of thousands of legal documents, the Legal Intelligence API, and the goal to innovate in search of legal documents we created Leegle (Legal Google).
            </p>
            <p> 
                    Leegle is an in-browser graph based legal document explorer, where documents are linked
                    by common court cases and law references. The tool seamlessly integrated with the
                    existing Legal Intelligence search engine using a simple Chrome browser plugin.

            <p>
                The objective of this 24 hour hackathon was to create anything that could be of value to the Dutch intelligence service. With this vague problem statement, we talked to various stakeholders, and identified that a big part of preventing extremism is identifying those that may develop extremist views.
            </p>
            <p> 
            We created <i>TerrorFlow</i>, a tool for automatically detecting individuals that are at risk of turning to extremism. This was done by identifying various objects in images and videos (e.g. burning flags, AK-47s) posted publicly on Instagram and Youtube, the results of which could be viewed in an in-browser tool.

                    Wrote the most popular Kaggle kernel in the biggest yearly machine learning competi-

                    retinopathy, which is the leading cause of blindness in the US, from retina pictures.
                    Trained on GPUs on a large cluster, achieving better than human expert performance.

extraction based on kNN clusters of image patches, which performed worse.
