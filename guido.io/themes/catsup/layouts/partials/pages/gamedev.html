            As a hobby, I like to work on video games. I think they provide a lot of unique challenges development wise. Video games are the intersection of many types of art, and actually seeing somebody have fun experiencing what you created is the most magical thing. </p>
        <p>
            <i>"Juice it or lose it"</i> is my motto in game development (and anything that a user interacts with really). Juice
            can be described as anything that doesn't change the functionality of a program, but just makes it
            <i>feel</i> better.

            <h2>üöÄ Ludum Dare</h2>
            Ludum Dare is the biggest online gamejam that is held three times per year. In the solo competition, you are given a theme
            and 48 hours to create everything from scratch. That includes art, music and sound effects!

                My first Ludum Dare entry, featuring a rather sad story and three mini-games. I was able to complete a much bigger game than I anticipated, and it was received pretty well. This game is what got me hooked on gamejams during university.

                [...] the opening is a tad slow. But the atmosphere and mood is perfect! Love the gameplay and design choice.

                Very touching and beautiful. I completed the first two levels in a dream-like determination that I knew Sam would feel. But I failed the third level without realizing the crucial thing that might've kept him alive. A sad game. Stunning end sequence.

                    I only had four hours for this gamejam, but managed to create a flappy bird-esque game. You are a submarine and can only steer and propel yourself underwater, so once you are out of the water all you can do is pray as you aim for the hole in the obstacle.

                    I really like the game. It's kinda like flappy birds - takes time to learn but once you do, you're hooked.

                    My most succesful gamejam game, and the one I am most proud of. It ended up 5th in theme, and 6th overall (out of more than 2500 entries)! Also it got featured on the Unity blog :D

                  In this game you place satellites in orbit and make a message transmission mesh to ensure cat videos can be sent throughout the solar system without package loss. Calm music, a parallax space scene, and an embedded police tracker (LAPD) make for an amazing atmosphere.

                    Technically challenging game to implement (Phaser.js was not really made for this kind of game), but ended up being too hard. It was bang on with the theme though, reaching 6th place in theme. First game I applied a vector graphics style (made in Inkscape).
