            Tygo is a tool for generating Typescript typings from Golang source files that just works.
        </p><p>
            It preserves comments, understands constants and also supports non-struct type expressions. It's perfect for generating equivalent types for a Golang REST API to be used in your front-end codebase.

          This was a particulary large undertaking because the browser (javascript) does not ship
          with any good support for multidimensional arrays or utilities like slicing, that all
          had to be implemented from scratch.

        <p>
          Utilities for converting PyTorch models to Keras and the other way around. More

          model in Keras and vice-versa.

        <p>
          I created this tool out of my own need, and since open sourcing it it has been starred
          over a hundred times on GitHub. <br />
          It is unique in the way it works from other tools, as it does not infer the model
          structure itself. That is where every other tool has the most difficulty (and often
          fails). In this tool instead you define the same model architecture yourself.

        <p>
          Armed with access to a large corpus of hundreds of thousands of legal documents, the
          Legal Intelligence API, and the goal to innovate in search of legal documents we
          created Leegle (Legal Google).
        </p>
        <p>
          Leegle is an in-browser graph based legal document explorer, where documents are linked
          by common court cases and law references. The tool seamlessly integrated with the
          existing Legal Intelligence search engine using a simple Chrome browser plugin.

        <p>
          The objective of this 24 hour hackathon was to create anything that could be of value
          to the Dutch intelligence service. With this vague problem statement, we talked to
          various stakeholders, and identified that a big part of preventing extremism is
          identifying those that may develop extremist views.
        </p>
        <p>
          We created <i>TerrorFlow</i>, a tool for automatically detecting individuals that are
          at risk of turning to extremism. This was done by identifying various objects in images
          and videos (e.g. burning flags, AK-47s) posted publicly on Instagram and Youtube, the
          results of which could be viewed in an in-browser tool.
