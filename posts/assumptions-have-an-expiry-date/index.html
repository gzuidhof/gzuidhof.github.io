<h2 id="assumptions-almost-never-hold">Assumptions almost never hold<a class="anchor" href="#assumptions-almost-never-hold">#</a></h2>
<p>The first customers in your SaaS product may be fine having a single e-mail linked to their account. But that doesn&rsquo;t work for everyone.</p>
<p>As your product gains adoption, more and more users ask to have a way to invite their colleagues to their account by e-mail. The assumption of <code>“one e-mail address &lt;&gt; one account”</code> is no longer good enough. The next step is to build a <code>teams</code> abstraction in your code, where one team consists of multiple users.</p>
<p>Should you have built this abstraction into your code from day one? <a href="https://blog.bullettrain.co/teams-should-be-an-mvp-feature/">Some say you should</a>, and in this case I agree. Some things are however better left for later - actually finishing and shipping your software also seems important.</p>
<h2 id="trade-off">Trade off<a class="anchor" href="#trade-off">#</a></h2>
<p>There is a trade-off between keeping things simple versus flexible. The most important part of building a new product is to see if it solves a problem and can sustain a business. The goal is not to have the perfect future-proof codebase.</p>
<p>The question to ask is <em>&ldquo;which assumptions can I get away with and for how long?&rdquo;</em>.</p>
<h2 id="exactly-one-relationships-seem-to-never-hold">Exactly one relationships seem to never hold<a class="anchor" href="#exactly-one-relationships-seem-to-never-hold">#</a></h2>
<p>Often these assumptions seem to be around <em><strong>exactly one</strong></em> relationships. <code>One e-mail &lt;-&gt; one paying customer</code> didn&rsquo;t hold for us. <em>Exactly one</em> relationships seem to be rather rare in the human and engineered world, but they can be a good-enough starting point.</p>
<p>Some example simplifying assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>A customer account
<ul>
<li>only needs a single login</li>
<li>has one address, in one country, and speaks one common language.</li>
<li>has one billing account</li>
<li>has only one internal team that uses your product</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A person
<ul>
<li>has one name</li>
<li>has one nationality</li>
<li>can be married to one person at a time</li>
<li>identifies as one gender</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Your server code
<ul>
<li>only needs to talk to one S3 bucket</li>
<li>only needs to run on one operating system</li>
<li>has one ground truth source for who is entitled to which features</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-decide">How to decide?<a class="anchor" href="#how-to-decide">#</a></h2>
<p>Some assumptions can be held longer than others. It’s a good idea to estimate when simplifying assumptions will bite you when designing your domain model.</p>
<p>Is it when you have 10 customers, 1000 customers, or do you expect that it will never be an issue? How much of a pain would it be to undo this assumption?</p>
<p>Depending on the answer you may want to spend some extra effort to reduce your future regret.</p>
