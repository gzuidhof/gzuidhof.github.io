##2011
**Minecraft Server Plugins** In the extra long holiday leading up to my first year in university I started learning about creating plugins for Bukkit (a Minecraft server extension). In the process I picked up basic Java. 

My plugins started out simple, for instance, a notification when a player was in the server for a specified amount of time (*"You should take a break"*). Although later during the year, as I was following imperative and object oriented programming classes I could begin to up my game. Creating plugins for [music](http://youtu.be/ee2y2ZWUgmc), [lightning arrows](http://youtu.be/vnAA89H0wUg), [light sensors](http://youtu.be/TzNVl3Pkf_c) and more. 

These plugins became quite popular, getting just under 100,000 downloads in total (for servers, so who knows how many people encountered my plugins). 

It turned out to be a great way to learn programming, actually make something which creates value for someone, and earn a little (doing custom plugins). Also, it gave me a headstart over peers in my class who had never programmed before starting their studies.

##2009 - 2011
**TI-84 Game Development** My first beginnings as a programmer, creating games for me and friends to play. Included text-based pok√©mon, text-based Sim City and story adventure games. 

My fingers hurt thinking about pressing the alpha key for every letter one would type, combined with the alphabetical order of the keys. It was however, a nice way to kill time during forced studying hours (which were a nice introduction by the government..).

I wish I still had these games, I had to wipe them for my finals :(
