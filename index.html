            As a hobby, I like to work on video games. I think they provide a lot of unique challenges development wise. Video games are the intersection of many types of art, and actually seeing somebody have fun experiencing what you created is the most magical thing. </p>
        <p>
            <i>"Juice it or lose it"</i> is my motto in game development (and anything that a user interacts with really). Juice
            can be described as anything that doesn't change the functionality of a program, but just makes it
            <i>feel</i> better.

            <h2>üöÄ Ludum Dare</h2>
            Ludum Dare is the biggest online gamejam that is held three times per year. In the solo competition, you are given a theme
            and 48 hours to create everything from scratch. That includes art, music and sound effects!

                My first Ludum Dare entry, featuring a rather sad story and three mini-games. I was able to complete a much bigger game than I anticipated, and it was received pretty well. This game is what got me hooked on gamejams during university.

                Very touching and beautiful. I completed the first two levels in a dream-like determination that I knew Sam would feel. But I failed the third level without realizing the crucial thing that might've kept him alive. A sad game. Stunning end sequence.

                    I only had four hours for this gamejam, but managed to create a flappy bird-esque game. You are a submarine and can only steer and propel yourself underwater, so once you are out of the water all you can do is pray as you aim for the hole in the obstacle.

                  In this game you place satellites in orbit and make a message transmission mesh to ensure cat videos can be sent throughout the solar system without package loss. Calm music, a parallax space scene, and an embedded police tracker (LAPD) make for an amazing atmosphere.

                    Technically challenging game to implement (Phaser.js was not really made for this kind of game), but ended up being too hard. It was bang on with the theme though, reaching 6th place in theme. First game I applied a vector graphics style (made in Inkscape).

                A very ambitious project for a 48 hour competition, a top down game in which you can unlock file spells to solve puzzles and beat enemies. I partnered up with an internet stranger who created some 3D assets. The review by Broxxar below sums up my learnings perfectly.

                An impressive amount of content and mechanics for a 48 hour jam, though some areas of the game felt like the needed a bit of polish. I think you could create a stronger jam game if you put quality before quantity. Great work on this though; a lengthy and complete feeling game is impressive in just 48 hours.

            <h2>üîó Chain Jam</h2>
            Chain Jam was a one-off gamejam in which all participants created a local multiplayer game that would then be played in succession with the other participants' games. Creating something similar to Mario Party mini-games.

                A simple local multiplayer game that tries to do one thing with a lot of juice and polish. Players jump and then freeze themselves, creating a stepping stone for the next life. The goal is to get as high as possible. Created in around 5 hours.

                    A one versus one slime soccer game, created to demonstrate the effectiveness of juice. <a href="https://jorisvanvugt.com">One of my best friends</a> and I decided that it was worth creating a game in which we could introduce juice incrementally during our talk on game development as a hobby, Unity, and juice.
                    <br><br>
                    The final product is a surprisingly fun game that I have seen friends play for hours (really).
