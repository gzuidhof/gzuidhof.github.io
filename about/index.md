I am an Artificial Intelligence student at Radboud University Nijmegen. Aged 20-something.

## Some things I like:

* Game development, I have partaken in quite a few gamejams. [My latest Ludum Dare entry](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-30/?action=preview&uid=23945) ended up 6th out of 1493 overall!
* Virtual reality, and in particular WebVR (VR in your ordinary browser).
* Open source. I aim to write most of my projects with an open license, others may use and or learn from it one day. Also it is fun to explore old projects.
* Haxe language. I love the idea of writing in one language and being able to target anything from browsers to toasters with good performance. I think it deserves more attention than it gets.
* The latest in tech world. I'm an avid hackernews and proggit reader.
* Airsoft. Occasionally I join a skirm and practice my 360-noscopes in real life.
