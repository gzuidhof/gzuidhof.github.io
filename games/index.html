            Back in university I used to develop video games as a hobby. Game development provides a lot
            of unique technical challenges. Video games are the intersection of many types of
            art, and actually seeing somebody enjoy the game you have built is the most
            magical thing.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>"Juice it or lose it"</i> is a great motto in game development. Juice can be described as anything that doesn't change the
            functionality of a program, but just makes it <i>feel</i> better.

            <h2>üïπÔ∏è Ludum Dare</h2>
            Ludum Dare is the biggest online gamejam that is held three times per year. In the solo
            competition, you are given a theme and 48 hours to create everything from scratch. That
            includes art, music and sound effects!

              My latest Ludum Dare entry, featuring a boring game with a novel input method. You control 
              the game by tilting you phone. It received the #1 score for innovation in the gamejam!
              Cloudflare invited me to write a blog post for their blog about the technical details.

            <blockquote class="project-quote">
                Super unique concept, and controls work surprisingly well. A couple complaints. A lot of the dots tend to be on the edge. Early on it makes the game far too challenging. As well, There is no punishment for NOT going after the dots. If I wanted to I could prop my phone up at an angle and it would continue to go in circles and earn points forever(provided my speed was low enough). Obstacles as well as making the dots larger would incentivize collecting them. Regardless, really interesting mechanic!

              My first Ludum Dare entry, featuring a rather sad story and three mini-games. I was
              able to complete a much bigger game than I anticipated, and it was received pretty
              well. This game is what got me hooked on gamejams during university.

              I only had four hours for this gamejam, but managed to create a flappy bird-esque game.
              You are a submarine and can only steer and propel yourself underwater, so once you are
              out of the water all you can do is pray as you aim for the hole in the obstacle.

              I really like the game. It's kinda like flappy birds - takes time to learn but once you
              do, you're hooked.

              My most succesful gamejam game, and the one I am most proud of. It ended up 5th in
              theme, and 6th overall (out of more than 2500 entries)! Also it got featured on the
              Unity blog :D
            </p>

            <p>
              In this game you place satellites in orbit and make a message transmission mesh to
              ensure cat videos can be sent throughout the solar system without package loss. Calm
              music, a parallax space scene, and an embedded police tracker (LAPD) make for an
              amazing atmosphere.

              Technically challenging game to implement (Phaser.js was not really made for this kind
              of game), but ended up being too hard. It was bang on with the theme though, reaching
              6th place in theme. First game I applied a vector graphics style (made in Inkscape).

              A very ambitious project for a 48 hour competition, a top down game in which you can
              unlock file spells to solve puzzles and beat enemies. I partnered up with an internet
              stranger who created some 3D assets. The review by Broxxar below sums up my learnings
              perfectly.

              An impressive amount of content and mechanics for a 48 hour jam, though some areas of
              the game felt like the needed a bit of polish. I think you could create a stronger jam
              game if you put quality before quantity. Great work on this though; a lengthy and
              complete feeling game is impressive in just 48 hours.

            <h2>üîó Chain Jam</h2>
            Chain Jam was a one-off gamejam in which all participants created a local multiplayer
            game that would then be played in succession with the other participants' games. Creating
            something similar to Mario Party mini-games.

              A simple local multiplayer game that tries to do one thing with a lot of juice and
              polish. Players jump and then freeze themselves, creating a stepping stone for the next
              life. The goal is to get as high as possible. Created in around 5 hours.

              A one versus one slime soccer game, created to demonstrate the effectiveness of juice.
              <a href="https://jorisvanvugt.com">Joris</a> and I decided that it was worth creating a
              game in which we could introduce juice incrementally during our talk on game
              development as a hobby, Unity, and juice. <br /><br />
              The final product is a surprisingly fun game that I have seen friends play for hours
              (really). It has over the top screenshake, disco colour background, hitmarkers, music
              that keeps going faster, slow-mo goals, and more juice.
